# Vinayak-Ai-XO-Game
This is my first ever project in Java, built after learning the basics of the language like variables, loops, conditionals, functions, arrays, and classes. It’s a console-based Tic Tac Toe game where the player (O) competes against an Vinayak-AI (X) powered by a recursive minimax strategy

🎮 Play Tic Tac Toe against VinayakAI (X)

Want to test your skills against VinayakAI, the unbeatable Tic Tac Toe bot?
Here’s how you can play:

🖥️ Option 1:
Download the Java file and run it using any Java IDE (like IntelliJ, Eclipse) or your terminal.

📱 Option 2:
Copy and paste the code into an online Java compiler like:

🔗 https://onecompiler.com/java
🔗 https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_java_compiler

Run the code, follow the prompts in the console, and try your best to beat VinayakAI (X).
Spoiler: It’s not that easy 😉
