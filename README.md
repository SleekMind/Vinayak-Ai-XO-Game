# Vinayak-Ai-XO-Game
This is my first ever project in Java, built after learning the basics of the language like variables, loops, conditionals, functions, arrays, and classes. It’s a console-based Tic Tac Toe game where the player (O) competes against an Vinayak-AI (X) powered by a recursive minimax strategy

🎮 Play Tic Tac Toe against VinayakAI (X)

Here’s how you can play:

🖥️ Option 1:

📱 Option 2:
Download the Java file and run it using any Java IDE (like IntelliJ, Eclipse) or your terminal.

Spoiler: It’s not that easy 😉
