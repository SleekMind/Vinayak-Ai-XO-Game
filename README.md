# Vinayak-Ai-XO-Game

While learning Java for backend, I found myself missing DSA — so I decided to build something fun. This is a console-based Tic Tac Toe game where the player (O) faces off against Vinayak-AI (X), powered by a recursive minimax game theory strategy, helping me practice the syntax I had just learned.
